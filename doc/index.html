<p>RubyNEAT is under intense development, and then will be under intense
documentation, as this is expected to be a full blown pure Ruby
implementation of the NEAT algorithm by Kenneth Stanley:</p>

<h2 id="label-Quick+and+Dirty+Docs">Quick and Dirty Docs</h2>

<p>There is an (extreme) alpha RubyGEM. Just do:</p>

<p>gem install rubyneat –pre</p>

<p>Then type:</p>

<p>neat</p>

<p>to see the list of commands. The workflow aspect of Rails is loosely
mirrored here.</p>

<p>To generate a new NEAT project, type:</p>

<p>neat new PROJECTNAME</p>

<p>and a project directory will be created. Cd into that directory, and type:</p>

<p>neat generate neater NEATERNAME</p>

<p>and a scaffold Neater will be generated. Note that this generator is still
in alpha, but improvements are coming shortly.</p>

<h2 id="label-Enhanced+Substrate+HyperNEAT">Enhanced Substrate HyperNEAT</h2>

<p>This version (and all subsequent versions) has the iterated ES HyperNEAT
feature added. This represents a significant leap in the power of RubyNEAT,
and as such will make this available to solve a wider class of problems.</p>

<p>The decision to leapfrog HyperNEAT was made primarily on a number of
fronts. for starters, HyperNEAT is very sensitive to changes in the CPPN,
where ES HyperNEAT regenerates the neurons in the substrate on each and
every change (evolution) of the CPPN. In this way, more stability can be
had. On the other hand, it makes the expression phase more computationally
expensive.</p>

<p>We will seek hard-nosed ways to optimize the expressor performance.</p>

<p>Also, with the dashboard will have to grow some extra abilities to provides
visualization.</p>

<h2 id="label-Modularization">Modularization</h2>

<p>On the heels of ES HyperNEAT, we needed to add modularization to make that
possible. We expose this modularization for direct usage outside of
HyperNEAT, so that you may compose modules of ANNs and their relationships,
which mirrors how the brain has &#39;modules&#39; of specific
functionality.</p>

<p>You of course may mix and match ES HyperNEAT modules with NEAT modules.
We&#39;ll leave that to your imagination. This modularization should not be
confused with the modularization that may automatically arise within ES
HyperNEAT itself. Please see the Wiki for a deeper exploration of these
ideas,</p>

<h2 id="label-Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>For some examples, clone or fork the following:</p>

<p>Feel free to add your own and do pull requests so that we can have more
examples of using RubyNEAT.</p>

<h2 id="label-Also+Note">Also Note</h2>

<p>For now, see</p>

<p><a
href="https://github.com/flajann2/rubyneat">github.com/flajann2/rubyneat</a></p>

<p>for the Github version, and this will probably be the better option until
this gets out of alpha. There are a couple of example Neaters there (one of
which is still in development). Basic, but will be a good example of how to
implement your own Neater. Eventually all will be fully documented.</p>

<h2 id="label-Release+Notes">Release Notes</h2>
<ul><li>
<p><code>0.5.0.hyper.alpha.0</code> Indroduction of multicritter (actually
multi-genenome) modularity, ES HyperNEAT (which does not require
multi-genome as such, as it&#39;s handled mostly in the Expressor)</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>0.3.5.alpha.7</code></p>

<p>Console made functional.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>0.4.0.alpha.0</code></p>

<p>Added a pop parameter to the report hook function. All example code in
rubyneat_examples updated. You will need to add the additional parameter to
your Neaters on your report hooks.</p>

<p>Also, added stronger support for plugins. In particular, an attr_neat
attribute processor was added to NeatOb, to support default settings as
well as hooks. Now, all plugins need to do is to hook into these hook
functions to get notifications.</p>
</li></ul>
